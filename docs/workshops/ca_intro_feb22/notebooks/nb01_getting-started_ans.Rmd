# Overview

This Notebook will demonstrate how you can use caladaptR to:

- create a Cal-Adapt API request object for a point location
- fetch data from Cal-Adapt  
- plot the data as a time series

\

# Setup

The first thing we do is to load caladaptR and the other package we're going to need. (If you haven't installed these yet, see this [setup script](https://github.com/ucanr-igis/caladaptr-res/blob/main/docs/workshops/ca_intro_oct21/scripts/caladaptr_setup.R)). 

```{r chunk01, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, results='hold'}
library(caladaptr)
library(units)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(tidyr)
```

We use the `conflicted` package to tell R which package we want it to use for some common function names:

```{r chunk02, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, results='hold'}
library(conflicted)
conflict_prefer("filter", "dplyr", quiet = TRUE)
conflict_prefer("count", "dplyr", quiet = TRUE)
conflict_prefer("select", "dplyr", quiet = TRUE)
```

# Part I. Get temperature data for a point location

In Part I, you generate a time series plot of projected maximum annual temperature like the one below for a point location using the four recommended GCMs for California and emissions scenario RCP 4.5.

## 1\. Create the API Request 

The first step in getting climate variables back is to create a Cal-Adapt API request object. This involves stringing together a series of functions that specify the pieces of the request. 

The following will create an API request for projected temperature data from Scripps:

```{r chunk03}
pt1_cap <- ca_loc_pt(coords = c(-119.168765, 35.487802)) %>%
  ca_gcm(gcms[1:4]) %>%                                 
  ca_scenario(c("rcp45", "rcp85")) %>%
  ca_period("year") %>%
  ca_years(start = 2030, end = 2080) %>%
  ca_cvar(c("tasmin", "tasmax"))
```

\

**Pro Tip:**

- the order of the constructor functions doesn't matter

- when entering coordinates, they must be i) in decimal degrees, and ii) formatted as *longitude, latitude* (in that order!)

- this example creates an API request for modeled climate data; for other datasets you might use different constructor functions

- you don't have to memorize a bunch of keywords. `caladaptr` has several built-in constants that contain the values you can pass to API construction functions, including `gcms`, `scenarios`, `cvars`, and `periods`.

\

#### Your turn

Enter the following constants to see what they contain `gcms`, `scenarios`, `cvars`, and `periods` [[Answer](https://bit.ly/3kRUP5Y)].

```{r chunk04}
gcms

scenarios

cvars

periods
```

**Pro Tip:**

- not every combination of GCM, scenario, climate variable, and period has a data set

- these constants are useful for constructing API requests for modeled climate data; they may not be needed for other datasets

\

## 2\. Examine an API Request

To see what's in an API request object, type its name at the console:

```{r chunk05}
pt1_cap
```

**Pro Tip:**

- you can customize the colors with `ca_settings()`. Let `console_colors` = `"dark"` or `light` depending on your RStudio color background.

```{r chunk06}
ca_settings(console_colors = "dark")
pt1_cap
```

\

You can double-check if your API request is complete by passing it to `ca_preflight()`:

```{r chunk07}
pt1_cap %>% ca_preflight()
```

\

To verify the location in an API request, you can plot it:

```{r chunk08}
plot(pt1_cap)
```

**Pro Tip:**

- To view the LOCA grid cells, add `locagrid = TRUE` to the plot command.

```{r chunk09}
plot(pt1_cap, locagrid = TRUE)
```


#### Your Turn:

Where is this point located? [[Answer](https://bit.ly/3uqUx96)].

Answer: in Shafter (outside Bakersfield), Kern County, CA

\

## 3\. Fetch Data

Now it's time to fetch data by feeding our API request into `ca_getvals_tbl()`. The object returned will be a tibble (data frame):  

```{r chunk10, cache = TRUE}
pt1_tbl <- pt1_cap %>% ca_getvals_tbl(quiet = TRUE)

head(pt1_tbl)
```

\

## 4\. Wrangle the Results for Plotting

To produce the desired time series plot, we need to i) pull out just values for RCP 4.5, and ii) convert degrees to &#176;F. For the unit conversion, we can use the handy `set_units` function from the `units` package.

```{r chunk11}
pt1_rcp45_tbl <- pt1_tbl %>%
  filter(scenario == "rcp45", cvar == "tasmax") %>%
  mutate(temp_f = set_units(val, degF))

pt1_rcp45_tbl %>% head()
```

\

## 5\. Plot the Time Series

Plot these with ggplot:

```{r chunk12, cache = TRUE}
ggplot(data = pt1_rcp45_tbl, aes(x = as.Date(dt), y = as.numeric(temp_f))) +
  geom_line(aes(color=gcm)) +
  labs(title = "Average Maximum Daily Temperature Per Year for RCP4.5", x = "year", y = "temp (F)")
```

### Challenge 1

Modify the above to create a similar plot for RCP 8.5. [[Answer](https://bit.ly/3F4Vity)].

```{r chunk13}
pt1_rcp85_tbl <- pt1_tbl %>%
  filter(scenario == "rcp85", cvar == "tasmax") %>%
  mutate(temp_f = set_units(val, degF))

ggplot(data = pt1_rcp85_tbl, aes(x = as.Date(dt), y = as.numeric(temp_f))) +
  geom_line(aes(color=gcm)) +
  labs(title = "Average Maximum Daily Temperature Per Year for RCP8.5", x = "year", y = "temp (F)")
```

### Challenge 2

For the same point, make a plot of average maximum temperature year for the same 4 GCMs for the period 1950-2005. [[Hint](https://bit.ly/3oWB12V)]. [[Answer](https://bit.ly/3I3ZVp2)].

```{r chunk14}
pt1_hist_cap <- ca_loc_pt(coords = c(-119.168765, 35.487802)) %>%
  ca_gcm(gcms[1:4]) %>%                                 
  ca_scenario("historical") %>%
  ca_period("year") %>%
  ca_years(start = 1950, end = 2005) %>%
  ca_cvar("tasmax")

pt1_hist_cap %>% ca_preflight()

pt1_hist_tbl <- pt1_hist_cap %>% 
  ca_getvals_tbl(quiet = TRUE)

pt1_hist_degf_tbl <- pt1_hist_tbl %>%
  mutate(temp_f = set_units(val, degF))

ggplot(data = pt1_hist_degf_tbl, aes(x = as.Date(dt), y = as.numeric(temp_f))) +
  geom_line(aes(color=gcm)) +
  labs(title = "Average Maximum Daily Temperature Per Year for Historical Emission Scenario", x = "year", y = "temp (F)")
```
