# Overview

This Notebook will give an overview of using caladaptR in Shiny.

An easy way to run sample Shiny apps powered by Cal-Adapt is using the `caladaptr.apps` package. After loading the package, you can launch an app with `ca_lauch()`:

```{r}
library(caladaptr.apps)

## Run the following to launch the timeseries sample app:
# ca_launch("timeseries")
```

\

**Pro Tip:**

- when you're done using a Shiny app, close the browser tab and click the 'Stop' button above the RStudio console.

\

To see the Shiny app code side-by-side the app, add `display.mode = "showcase"`.

```{r}
# ca_launch("timeseries", display.mode = "showcase")
```
