### Emission Scenarios for Projected Climate

---

A big variable in what the future climate will look like is the amount of carbon that goes into the atmosphere between now and then. Nobody knows what exactly will happen, but climate scientists have come up with different scenarios called [*Representative Concentration Pathways*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway) (RCPs).

Projected climate data from Cal-Adapt are available for two RCPs. **RCP 4.5** is an intermediate scenario where emissions peak around 2040, then start to decline. **RCP 8.5** on the other hand assumes that emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century. RCP 8.5 represents a worst-case scenario, and even though we hope that society will be able to get atmospheric carbon under control, it's worth considering when making decisions.

Because we really don't know how carbon emissions will play out, you should definitely project future chill under **both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5** scenarios and compare.
