### Select a Time Period for Climate Data

---

Whenever you use data from climate models, it is strongly recommended to use at least **20-30 years** to even out the bumps.

In this calculator, the growing season year is the year when harvest occurs. So for example if the year range is 2040-2060, and the month to count chill portions is September, the calculator will fetch projected temperatures starting on September 1, 2039.
