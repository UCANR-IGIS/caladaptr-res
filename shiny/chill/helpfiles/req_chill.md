### Required Chill Portions

---

Different cultivars of fruit and nut trees require different amounts of chill portions to blossom. You can look-up the amount of <a href='http://fruitsandnuts.ucdavis.edu/Weather_Services/chilling_accumulation_models/CropChillReq/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>chill portions required for specific cultivars</a> and enter the value as the required chill portions value. 

The calculator will tell you the likelihood is of reaching the required chill portions by the end of the season for each time period and emissions scenario. The likelihood estimate assumes all GCMs and all years in the time period are equally likely.
