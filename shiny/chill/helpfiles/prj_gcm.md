### GCMs for Projected Climate

---

**GCM = global climate model**. These are the big computer models that simulate how the land, sea, and air interact and change over time. They can simulate climate variables (temperature and precipitation) in both the future and the past, and for different emissions scenarios.

**Which GCM(s) should I use?** The California 4th Climate Change Assessment recommended 10 of the 32 GCMs out there for use in California. Furthermore, they identified 4 of those 10 models as representing the full range of potential climate futures. The default setting for this calculator are those 4 priority models, but you can use any of the 10 models all of which are available from Cal-Adapt.

There is definitely variability between models, so it is recommended that you **use at least 4 GCMs** when you run the calculator.
