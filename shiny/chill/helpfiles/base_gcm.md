### GCMs for the Historic Baseline

---

**GCM = global climate model**. These are the big computer models that simulate how the land, sea, and air interact and change over time. They can simulate climate variables (temperature and precipitation) in both the future and the past, and for different emissions scenarios.

**Why use a model to compute historic chill? Don't we have records?** Although it may be counter-intuitive to use climate models to measure historic chill portions, as opposed to weather station records, it's actually preferable in this case. In this calculator, we're primarily using the historic baseline as a reference point to interpret the projected conditions. Thus by  using the same climate models for the historic period as the projected future, you are comparing apples to apples. Also the climate models have been shown to do a very good job in matching the general patterns of historic temperature and precipitation.

**Which GCM(s) should I use?** The California 4th Climate Change Assessment recommended 10 of the 32 GCMs out there for use in California. Furthermore, they identified 4 of those 10 models as representing the full range of potential climate futures. The default setting for this calculator are those 4 priority models, but you can use any of the 10 models all of which are available from Cal-Adapt.

It is recommended that you **use at least 4 GCMs** when you use the calculator, as there is variability between the models.
