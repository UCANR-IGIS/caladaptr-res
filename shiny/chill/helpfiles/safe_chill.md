## Safe Chill Certainty Level

---

*'Safe chill'* is the minimum number of chill portions a grower can expect to get *x*% of the time, where *x* is the desired level of certainty.

Normally we use *x = 90%*, because most farm operations need to get a viable harvest 90% of the time to stay in business. But you can set any certainty level from 1..100.
